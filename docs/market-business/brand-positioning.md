## Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice Characteristics

**Intelligent, but not robotic**
We're smart and capable, but we speak like a helpful friend, not a corporate AI.

**Empowering, not condescending**
We trust families to make their own decisions. We provide tools, not judgment.

**Modern, but accessible**
We embrace technology without jargon or gatekeeping.

**Human, not corporate**
We're built by a solo developer with AI assistance. We're transparent, honest, and approachable.

### Tone Guidelines

- Be concise and direct (busy parents don't have time for fluff)
- Use real examples ("Doctor appointment → shopping list → pickup task")

- Be honest about limitations ("Feature coming in Phase 3")

**Don't**:
