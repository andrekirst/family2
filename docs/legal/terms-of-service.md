- **Event chains**: Automation may fail; always verify critical tasks manually

## 9. Indemnification

### 9.1 Your Obligation to Defend Us

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Family Hub, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorney fees) arising from:

- **Your use of the Service**: How you use or misuse Family Hub
- **Your content**: Content you upload that infringes others' rights

---

## 10. Dispute Resolution

### 10.1 Informal Resolution First

Before filing a lawsuit or arbitration, you agree to:

1. **Contact us**: Email legal@familyhub.app describing the dispute
2. **Give us 60 days**: We'll work in good faith to resolve it
3. **Escalate if needed**: If we can't resolve it, proceed to arbitration or small claims court

**Why?** Most disputes can be resolved quickly and cheaply through direct communication.

### 10.2 Binding Arbitration

If informal resolution fails, disputes will be resolved through **binding arbitration**, not court.

**What is arbitration?**
- A neutral third party (arbitrator) decides the dispute
- Less formal than court
- Usually faster and cheaper
- Decision is final and binding

**Arbitration Rules:**
- Governed by the **American Arbitration Association (AAA) Consumer Arbitration Rules**
- Arbitration conducted in **English**
- Location: Your county of residence (if in the US) or remotely via video conference
- Each party pays their own attorney fees unless the arbitrator decides otherwise

**AAA Information:**
- Website: www.adr.org
- Phone: 1-800-778-7879

### 10.3 Class Action Waiver

**YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES INDIVIDUALLY, NOT AS A CLASS ACTION.**

You cannot:
- Participate in a class action lawsuit against us
- Join a class arbitration
- Seek relief that affects other users

**Exception**: You can opt out of arbitration by emailing optout@familyhub.app within 30 days of accepting these Terms. If you opt out, disputes will be resolved in court.

### 10.4 Small Claims Court

You can bring claims in small claims court if they qualify under your state's small claims rules.

### 10.5 Exceptions to Arbitration

Arbitration does NOT apply to:
- Intellectual property disputes (copyright, trademark infringement)
- Injunctive relief (restraining orders, emergency court orders)
- Disputes under $500 (either party can choose small claims court)

### 10.6 Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the **State of Delaware, USA**, without regard to conflict of law principles.

If a court (not arbitration) has jurisdiction, the exclusive venue is the state or federal courts in **Wilmington, Delaware**.

These Terms, along with our Privacy Policy and any supplemental policies, constitute the entire agreement between you and Family Hub. They supersede any prior agreements or understandings.

### 12.2 Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect.

We're not liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond our reasonable control: natural disasters, war, terrorism, labor disputes, government actions, pandemics, or internet outages.

### 12.6 No Agency

Nothing in these Terms creates a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between you and Family Hub. You're not authorized to bind us contractually.

### 12.7 Electronic Communications

You consent to receive electronic communications from us (emails, in-app notifications). These communications satisfy any legal requirement for written notice.

**To opt out of promotional emails**: Click "Unsubscribe" in any marketing email (you'll still receive account-related emails).

### 12.8 Export Controls

You may not use the Service if you're located in a country embargoed by the United States or if you're on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals.
