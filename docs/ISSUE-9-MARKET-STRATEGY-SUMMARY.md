## 💰 Monetization Strategy

### Recommended Business Model: **Freemium SaaS**

**Free Tier** ("Family Starter"):
- Up to 3 family members
- Calendar (unlimited events)
- Tasks (unlimited)
- Shopping lists (unlimited)
- **NO ADS** (differentiator vs Cozi, TimeTree)
- No event chains (premium only)
- No meal planning
- No budget tracking

**Premium Tier** ("Family Plus"): **$9.99/month or $99/year**
- Unlimited family members

### Pricing Rationale

**Why $9.99/month?**
1. **Mid-Tier Gap**: Positioned between budget ($3-5/mo) and premium ($15/mo)

3. **Competitive**: Matches Picniic annual ($99.99/year) but positioned as mid-tier
4. **Psychology**: $9.99 vs $10.00 (charm pricing), annual discount (2 months free)
5. **Conversion**: 30%+ conversion potential (vs 20% industry average)

**Comparison to Competitors**:
- Cozi: $3.25/month (too cheap, implies limited features)
- FamilyWall: $4.99/month (no automation, why pay?)
- TimeTree: Free (ad-supported, privacy concerns)
- Picniic: $14.99/month (too expensive, high churn)
